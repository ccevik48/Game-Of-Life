# Game-Of-Life
John Conway's Game of Life implemented in HTML canvas and JavaScript

This implementation generates a grid on a canvas that randomizes every time the page is refreshed.
To use this, download the repository and open the index.html file in a browser (preferably chrome).
Here is a live demo: https://jsfiddle.net/1mhr2jvn/
